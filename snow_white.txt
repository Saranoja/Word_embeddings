My favourite fruit are bananas, oranges and apples. I like eating bananas the most because bananas are yellow. I hate red fruit like cherries. Cherries are ugly fruit. Some more interesting fruit are grapes, pears and mangos. There are sweet fruit like mangos, bananas, peaches or apples and there are sour fruit like oranges, lemons or cherries.
The best fruit are grapes. The colour of the bananas is yellow. The colour of lemons is yellow. Bananas and lemons are both yellow.
Cherries, apples can be red. Apples can also be green or yellow. Red is my favourite colour.
Marketing refers to activities a company undertakes to promote the buying or selling of a product or service. Marketing includes advertising, selling, and delivering products to consumers or other businesses. Some marketing is done by affiliates on behalf of a company. Professionals who work in a corporation's marketing and promotion departments seek to get the attention of key potential audiences through advertising. Promotions are targeted to certain audiences and may involve celebrity endorsements, catchy phrases or slogans, memorable packaging or graphic designs and overall media exposure.
Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described of which around 1 million are insects but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to 33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom Animalia includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology.
